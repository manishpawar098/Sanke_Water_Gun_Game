# Sanke_Water_Gun_Game
Snake-Water-Gun is a simple hand-game like Rock-Paper-Scissors. Two players (here: human vs computer) each choose one of three items: snake, water, or gun. The outcome depends on a fixed rule set. It's a great beginner Python project: random choice, input validation, loops, and simple scoring.
